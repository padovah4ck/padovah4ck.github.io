My name is Christian Danieli and I am yet another IT security guy. I live in Padua (Italy)  

I have a long experienced in the fields since I began writing code in '90s with MSX BASIC.  

Sometimes bugs really stumble upon me :) it's not my fault if I find them!  

Recently I'm focused on Windows security and Azure ops.

I hold some certifications (CEH , AZ300 & AZ301, GIAC GSSP.NET)  

I got some CVEs too..  

Anyway, I do like all that security stuff out there.. but it's a job after all! A nice one!  
What I really prefer is to spend time with my family - often go fishing and sometimes spearfishing!
